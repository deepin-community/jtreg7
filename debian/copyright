  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
  a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
  the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
  permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
  executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
  and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
  choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
  the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
  module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
  you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
  the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
  so, delete this exception statement from your version.
