<h1>The <em>jtreg</em> FAQ</h1>

This FAQ is a growing list of questions asked by developers running and 
writing tests which will be run using the regression test harness for the 
OpenJDK platform, <em>jtreg</em>. It is a supplement to the 
<a href="tag-spec.html">test-tag language specification</a> and is intended to 
illuminate implications of the spec and to answer questions about this 
implementation of the spec.
